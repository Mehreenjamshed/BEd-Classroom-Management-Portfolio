Reflection on the Role of a Teacher and Principal as Administrator and Manager
📘 Introduction
The school plays a vital role in the life and development of a child. Teachers are role models, and leadership is essential to provide the best student experience within the school system. The principal acts as a leader with multifaceted responsibilities, fulfilling both administrative and managerial duties. According to Lunenburg (2010), principals execute four key functions: planning, organizing, leading, and monitoring. Teachers also play a dynamic role in shaping the community through education and take on both administrative and managerial roles to ensure effective learning.

🧑‍🏫 Principal as an Administrator
The principal acts as a policymaker and ensures effective policy implementation. They shape educational foundations by overseeing curriculum development, teaching methodologies, and student assessments, all to uphold the highest educational standards. Principals also facilitate communication among teachers, students, parents, and higher authorities. Responsibilities like financial planning and resource allocation fall under their administrative role (Kaso, 2021).

👩‍🏫 Teacher as an Administrator
Teacher leadership begins in the classroom. The success of students is strongly influenced by teacher leadership rather than external factors. According to Öqvist & Malmström (2016), high levels of teacher leadership contribute to a positive learning environment that motivates students and enhances performance. Teachers act as administrators when they manage attendance, curriculum planning, extracurricular activities, and coordination efforts (Akbarovna, 2024).

🧑‍💼 Principal as a Manager
The principal manages the entire educational process, from staff recruitment to fulfilling student needs. Responsibilities include planning the curriculum, organizing events, overseeing exams and meetings, and conflict resolution between stakeholders. Principals also promote teamwork, accountability, and continuous development to establish a high-performing academic environment (Sharp & Walter, 2012).

👨‍🏫 Teacher as a Manager
Teachers as managers ensure smooth day-to-day functioning of the classroom. They are responsible for maintaining discipline, organizing students, managing resources (e.g., textbooks and teaching aids), lesson planning, student assessments, and exam schedules. Teachers also manage extracurricular events such as sports day, ensuring proper coordination and execution (Bizimana & Orodho, 2014).

📝 Conclusion
Principals and teachers play vital roles in both administrative and managerial capacities, working consistently toward student development and school improvement. Their effective performance supports the implementation of policies and proper resource management, contributing to the success of the entire educational system. Beyond the classroom, their efforts build a stronger community and nation.
