Project Title
Visual Learning Tools in Elementary Education: Evaluating Infographics as a Pedagogical Strategy in Science

Introduction
Effective classroom management goes beyond discipline; it includes how instruction is delivered, how students engage, and how the learning environment is structured. As part of our hands-on project for the School and Classroom Management course, our group explored the integration of visual learning tools—specifically infographics—in science education at the elementary level. The aim was to assess how these tools could enhance conceptual understanding and classroom engagement, particularly in underprivileged educational settings.

Project Overview and Objectives
Our core objectives were:

To create visually appealing and educational infographics for key science topics.

To evaluate their impact on students' learning and engagement in a real classroom setting.

To reflect on how such tools contribute to effective classroom management.

We selected five fundamental science topics from the Grade 4 General Science Punjab Textbook (SNC):

Ecosystem

States of Matter

Force and Motion

Human Health

Plant System

Each infographic was carefully designed using Canva (an online graphic design platform) and Mapify (a visual map creation tool) to enhance the visual impact and clarity of scientific concepts. The infographics included colorful illustrations, simplified explanations, and real-life examples tailored to young learners.

Fieldwork Implementation
We visited three elementary schools where access to modern educational resources is limited:

New Vision School, Green Town – visited by Mehreen Jamshed & Sadaf Nawaz

The Smart School – visited by Mehwish Saleem

Lahore Grammar School, Sharaqpur – visited by Mehreen Pervaiz

The students were from Grade 4 and had limited exposure to visual aids in their science classes.

During our sessions:
We introduced each infographic with a short interactive discussion.

Students were invited to ask questions, point to elements on the chart, and explain concepts in their own words.

Instead of using traditional oral lectures, we relied entirely on visual storytelling and interaction through infographics.

Outcomes and Student Feedback
The results were significantly positive:

Increased Engagement: Students remained attentive and excited throughout the sessions. The visual appeal captured their interest more effectively than standard teaching methods.

Improved Conceptual Understanding: Based on follow-up questions and informal quizzes, students were able to explain scientific processes accurately using the infographics as reference points.

Positive Feedback: Students shared that the visuals made it easier for them to understand and remember the content. They expressed that this method was "fun and clear" compared to lectures.

Teachers also appreciated the initiative and suggested incorporating infographics as a regular classroom practice.

Team Collaboration
Our project was a result of equal and active participation from all four members:
Mehreen Jamshed, Mehwish Saleem, Sadaf Nawaz, and Mehreen Pervaiz.

Each team member:

Selected one science topic from the Grade 4 curriculum

Designed a custom infographic using Canva and Mapify

Visited the assigned school

Delivered a teaching session using the infographic

Interacted with students and addressed their questions

Collected direct feedback from students

Regular meetings, brainstorming sessions, and feedback sharing helped us refine our approach and support each other through every phase of the project.

Conclusion
This project affirmed the significance of visual tools in enhancing both learning outcomes and classroom management—especially in under-resourced schools. Infographics not only simplified complex scientific ideas but also fostered a more engaging and inclusive learning environment. This hands-on experience deepened our understanding of how pedagogical strategies influence classroom dynamics and student motivation.
